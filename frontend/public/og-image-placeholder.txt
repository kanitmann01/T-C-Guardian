OG Image Placeholder

This file is a placeholder. To complete Phase 2:

1. Take a screenshot of your Dashboard (with analysis results visible)
2. Crop it to exactly 1200x630px
3. Save it as: frontend/public/og-image.png

The image should showcase:
- The T&C Guardian interface
- Risk analysis visualization
- Professional, clean design

For now, the meta tags are configured to use /og-image.png, but you'll need to create the actual image file.
